                        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 8, 2016</p>
                        
                        <p>Phantom Force, LP (“PF” or “we,”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to
                        our website www.hyperspektiv.com (the “Site”) and users of our HYPERSPEKTIV application
                        (the “App”). This privacy policy is intended to provide you with information about how PF
                        collects, uses, stores, and shares the information that you provide to us through the Site and the
                        App so that you may make appropriate choices for sharing information with us. The Site and the
                        App may provide links to third party websites. This privacy policy applies to our Site and App
                        and does not apply to third party websites. The treatment of information that you provide on such
                        third party website(s) is subject to the applicable privacy policies of the provider(s) of such
                        website(s). PF may collect, use, share and disclose information, as described below, from our
                        Site and from our App, which displays or is linked to this privacy policy.</p>
                        
                        <h1>The Information We Collect</h1>
                        
                        <p>PF does not require that you reveal any personally identifiable information to visit our Site or use
                        our App. However, you may elect to provide personally identifiable information to us, such as,
                        for example, your email address, when you voluntarily sign up to receive news and other
                        information from us, if you send us an email, or if you submit questions or comments to us about
                        the Site or the App.</p>
                        
                        <p>We may collect information for technical support or other business support reasons. This
                        generally consists of information that you enter, such as your email address, but may also include
                        some information collected by the Site or the App.</p>
                        
                        <p>The information we collect passively is not typically considered personal, but it may include or
                        be combined by us or our third party service providers with other personally identifiable
                        information, such as application, device or other identifiers. In most cases, App-related
                        information is collected passively by the App. This information may include or be associated
                        with a personal identifier, such as a device ID, and therefore, it may be used in a personally
                        identifiable way. For example, your device may be assigned a temporary id which may serve to
                        identify your device, your browsing activities, and your interactions with the App generally and
                        on social media. Similarly, your IP address, ISP, network configuration information, network
                        device information, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, platform, browser
                        activity, geographical region, gender, age, language, and session information are passively
                        collected by the App and our Site.</p>
                        
                        <p>We utilize other means of passively collecting information:</p>
                        
                        <p>“Cookies”. Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a user's hard
                        drive to keep records of his or her visit at the website. We may use cookies to improve your
                        experiences when visiting the Site, and to anonymously track interest in, and collect aggregate
                        information on, our Site.</p>
                        
                        <p>“IDFA”. IDFA is a tag or identifier which applies to your device(s) that utilize(s) Apple’s iOS.
                        We use the IDFA to customize our advertising to your preferences. You may reset the IDFA at
                        any time and opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called “Limit Ad Tracking”
                        (LAT), which is designed to restrict advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising.
                        Learn more about how to limit ad tracking on your iOS device or how to reset your IDFA by

                        <p>“Log files” are files that log actions that have occurred on a website. PF may use log files to
                        gather statistics about your browsing habits and to assess overall Site activity, including how
                        many "hits" a web page receives. Log entries are generated anonymously, are not associated with
                        any particular user, computer, or browser, and enable us to track interest promotions,
                        troubleshoot technical concerns, and provide users with content that may be of interest to them.
                        We also use this information for internal purposes to improve the App and the Site.
                        “Pixel Tags” are transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. We use pixels on our Site
                        to measure and understand our users so that we can customize our advertising.
                        “Tags” or “Container Tags”. Tags are little bits of code. We use Tags on our Site and in our App
                        and on our Site to help us to measure impressions across platforms in order to analyze the
                        responsiveness of our advertising campaigns and to better understand how you use and enjoy the
                        Site and the App.</p>
                        
                        <p>“Web beacons”. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages
                        of websites. We use web beacons to analyze traffic patterns on our Site, such as the frequency
                        with which users visit various pages of our Site. These technical methods may involve the
                        transmission of data to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our
                        behalf. We also use track HTML emails that we send so that we may understand whether users
                        have opened the emails or clicked on links contained in the emails. These technical methods may
                        collect information in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
                        
                        <p>Information collected via the Site and the App may be stored in the United States, and retained
                        until the purpose of collection or use or mandated retention period expires.</p>
                        
                        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
                        
                        <p>Information is used for the purpose for which it was collected. For example, information
                        collected for App-related purposes is used for operating or improving our Apps or App-related
                        features, information collected for business support purposes is used for business support
                        functions, and information passively collected from our Site is used for the purposes of operating
                        or improving our Site and for improved targeting of our marketing and advertising. Information
                        collected when you sign up for our mailing list is used by us to communicate to you news and
                        other information about the App and to inform you about offers we believe will be of interest to
                        you. We maintain information obtained from users who contact us so that we may assist these
                        customers with current or future product or service issues.</p>

                        <p>We may use personally identifiable information that we or our service providers collect for
                        demographic, market, or other internal studies which help us to improve the Site and the App, to
                        better meet our users’ needs, and for the advertising and marketing of our products and services.
                        Information that we have collected may also be used to provide you with future advertisements
                        that we believe will be of interest to you. From time to time we may conduct surveys or
                        questionnaires for users to provide feedback and additional information which allows PF to
                        improve its App and App-features.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
                        
                        <p>We may share information with third parties that provide services and assist us in realizing the
                        purposes described above. For example, we may disclose an application or device identifier to a
                        service provider for aggregation or analysis or for our marketing and advertising purposes. We
                        do not share information with unaffiliated third parties for their own independent marketing
                        purposes without your consent.</p>
                        
                        <p>We may also disclose and share information with law enforcement or regulatory bodies as
                        required or permitted by law.</p>
                        
                        <p>We may use and disclose personally identifying information and records for defense of a lawsuit,
                        investigation or other action if such personally identifying information, records or profiles are
                        relevant to the lawsuit, investigation or action.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Transfer of Your Information in the Event of Sale or Acquisition</h2>
                        
                        <p>In the event that PF sells or transfers its business or its business is acquired, our Site visitors’ and
                        App users’ stored personally identifying information may be transferred to the purchasing or
                        acquiring entity. By accepting this privacy policy, you also consent to the possible transfer of
                        your personally identifying information outside your country of residence.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Underage Users</h2>
                        
                        <p>While neither our Site nor our App is targeted to underage users, if we have knowledge that a
                        user is underage, or as otherwise required by law, we may delete the user’s information, and/or
                        attempt to notify and obtain parental consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the user’s
                        personal information.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>
                        
                        <p>Although we strive to protect personally identifying information, we cannot ensure or warrant
                        the security of any information transmitted to us through or in connection with our Site or our
                        App.</p>
                        
                        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal
                        information under our control that is collected from users of our Site and our App.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security. As a result, although we strive to protect
                        personally identifying information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
                        transmitted to us through or in connection with our Site and App, that we store on our systems or
                        that is stored on our service providers' systems.</p>
